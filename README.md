# StandArich2
Code to standardize allelic richness and plot population allelic frequencies.
The  purpose of this package is to standardize population sample size before comparing allelic richness (Ã‚) estimates among different populations. The problem of unequal sample size is typical in clonal species where G, the number of different genotypes or genetic individuals, is the relevant statistic to standardize.  Independently of the sample design used for clonal organisms G is unpredictable at that stage, even when N, the number of sample units, is kept constant across populations. Therefore for clonal species the data file should contain a single copy of each unique multilocus genotype (MLG) present for each population. For non-clonal species all MLG should be used, as the standardization is for N, and is normally necessary when the sample size used varied among populations.
Graphical tools are also available to produce 1) a bar plot of standardized allelic richness; 2)  allelic richness rarefraction curves for each population (allele.genotype.plot); and 3) plot allele distribution and frequency across populations for each locus (plot.allele.freq).
